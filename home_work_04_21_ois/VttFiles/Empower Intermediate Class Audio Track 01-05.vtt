00:00:00.441 --> 00:00:02.139
Track 01.05

00:00:04.861 --> 00:00:06.139
Kris: It all started with this

00:00:06.195 --> 00:00:08.140
online game about Vikings.

00:00:08.547 --> 00:00:09.436
Nicolas and I

00:00:09.531 --> 00:00:10.008
ended up

00:00:10.064 --> 00:00:11.072
on the same team

00:00:11.127 --> 00:00:12.762
and, after each game,

00:00:13.034 --> 00:00:14.431
there was this chat session.

00:00:15.133 --> 00:00:17.714
Well, Nicolas wrote these really funny

00:00:17.739 --> 00:00:19.254
comments about the teams and the

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:20.183
other players,

00:00:20.368 --> 00:00:21.415
and he made me laugh.

00:00:22.022 --> 00:00:23.863
I’d write replies to his comments,

00:00:24.067 --> 00:00:25.623
and he’d come back with another joke

00:00:25.648 --> 00:00:26.719
and, you know,

00:00:27.008 --> 00:00:27.889
it was a lot of fun.

00:00:28.779 --> 00:00:30.724
Then we sort of started messaging

00:00:30.749 --> 00:00:32.432
each other when we weren’t gaming.

00:00:33.251 --> 00:00:33.847
Like me,

00:00:33.888 --> 00:00:35.301
Nicolas is crazy about

00:00:35.341 --> 00:00:36.936
anything to do with Vikings –

00:00:37.209 --> 00:00:39.010
like, he’s read all the history

00:00:39.107 --> 00:00:41.146
and just knows so much.

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:42.705
We’ve never met up

00:00:42.768 --> 00:00:44.197
because he lives in Bogotá,

00:00:44.508 --> 00:00:45.294
in Colombia,

00:00:45.733 --> 00:00:47.383
so it’s not like we’re neighbours

00:00:47.408 --> 00:00:47.979
or anything.

00:00:48.649 --> 00:00:50.117
And that’s the other amazing

00:00:50.142 --> 00:00:50.864
thing about him.

00:00:51.522 --> 00:00:53.518
Like, he’s never left Colombia,

00:00:53.884 --> 00:00:56.178
but his English is almost perfect.

00:00:56.624 --> 00:00:57.863
We’ve spoken online –

00:00:58.532 --> 00:00:59.858
I don’t know how his English

00:00:59.883 --> 00:01:00.897
got to be so good.

00:01:01.813 --> 00:01:03.055
I have so much more in

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:04.032
common with Nicolas

00:01:04.068 --> 00:01:06.641
than I do with the friends I see every day.

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:12.609
Alex: Zohra and I met on this fan website

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:13.935
for The Hunger Games.

00:01:14.351 --> 00:01:16.415
We both think this is one of the most

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:19.226
amazing series of books we’ve ever read.

00:01:19.643 --> 00:01:21.016
But we both really enjoy

00:01:21.071 --> 00:01:22.786
other science fiction as well.

00:01:23.401 --> 00:01:24.862
A lot of people on the fan site

00:01:24.909 --> 00:01:26.134
just wanted to talk about

00:01:26.183 --> 00:01:27.071
The Hunger Games

00:01:27.149 --> 00:01:28.299
and nothing else,

00:01:28.755 --> 00:01:30.644
but Zohra was like me and wanted

00:01:30.669 --> 00:01:32.064
to read other writers –

00:01:32.504 --> 00:01:34.606
like, some of the classic writers

00:01:34.631 --> 00:01:35.655
of science fiction –

00:01:36.055 --> 00:01:37.587
Frank Herbert,

00:01:37.668 --> 00:01:39.295
Ursula K. Le Guin,

00:01:39.352 --> 00:01:40.510
Philip K. Dick –

00:01:40.599 --> 00:01:41.504
people like that.

00:01:41.966 --> 00:01:44.204
So for a while we would decide together

00:01:44.229 --> 00:01:45.293
what book to read,

00:01:45.503 --> 00:01:46.962
and after every chapter

00:01:46.987 --> 00:01:48.820
we’d discuss what had happened

00:01:48.845 --> 00:01:50.654
and guess what might happen next.

00:01:51.079 --> 00:01:52.912
I really enjoyed this way of reading.

00:01:53.494 --> 00:01:55.352
It kind of made it more interesting.

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:57.618
And then I had this idea

00:01:57.714 --> 00:02:00.023
that we could set up a book club online

00:02:00.048 --> 00:02:02.446
and, you know, include a few more people.

00:02:03.116 --> 00:02:05.656
But Zohra wasn’t too interested in that.

00:02:06.106 --> 00:02:08.233
I could sort of feel her pulling away.

00:02:08.887 --> 00:02:10.950
She didn’t text so often,

00:02:10.975 --> 00:02:12.919
and suddenly she didn’t have time to read

00:02:12.944 --> 00:02:13.872
a book together –

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:15.080
that sort of thing.

00:02:15.766 --> 00:02:16.480
That’s fine.

00:02:17.014 --> 00:02:19.014
I enjoyed having an online friend,

00:02:19.086 --> 00:02:21.419
but I didn’t want to have just one friend –

00:02:21.732 --> 00:02:22.748
I wanted more.

00:02:23.192 --> 00:02:23.811
In fact,

00:02:24.019 --> 00:02:25.646
now I’ve got a lot more –

00:02:26.054 --> 00:02:27.975
I set up the book club anyway.

00:02:30.647 --> 00:02:32.797
Kelly: I joined a discussion board called

00:02:32.822 --> 00:02:35.817
‘Greenie’ and I could see immediately that

00:02:35.938 --> 00:02:38.335
Joe was the guy with the best ideas.

00:02:38.798 --> 00:02:39.793
There were always a lot of

00:02:39.818 --> 00:02:40.619
comments about

00:02:40.664 --> 00:02:41.965
how bad things are,

00:02:42.167 --> 00:02:43.650
and how the environment is

00:02:43.675 --> 00:02:44.913
suffering and all that.

00:02:45.011 --> 00:02:46.402
But Joe was practical

00:02:46.427 --> 00:02:47.848
and would always ask,

00:02:48.063 --> 00:02:51.151
‘OK, so what are we going to do about it?’

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:53.080
and then he would suggest something –

00:02:53.331 --> 00:02:55.101
small and simple things,

00:02:55.187 --> 00:02:57.005
but practical things.

00:02:57.198 --> 00:02:58.484
You know, like,

00:02:58.565 --> 00:03:00.597
‘Everyone turn off your air conditioning

00:03:00.622 --> 00:03:01.962
and open the windows –

00:03:02.126 --> 00:03:03.769
sweat it out for the planet!’

00:03:04.382 --> 00:03:06.382
‘I like people who do stuff and

00:03:06.437 --> 00:03:08.136
don’t just talk about it.

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:10.189
Then I figured out that

00:03:10.214 --> 00:03:11.935
Joe and I live in the same town.

00:03:12.342 --> 00:03:12.787
So,

00:03:12.812 --> 00:03:14.117
we messaged a little

00:03:14.149 --> 00:03:15.737
and agreed to meet up.

00:03:16.378 --> 00:03:17.766
Together with some online

00:03:17.848 --> 00:03:20.411
friends and some face-to-face friends,

00:03:20.589 --> 00:03:22.708
we’ve set up a local action group.

00:03:23.227 --> 00:03:25.330
We got the city council to set aside

00:03:25.355 --> 00:03:26.656
some green areas

00:03:26.921 --> 00:03:28.564
and we’re raising money to buy

00:03:28.589 --> 00:03:30.127
trees to plant there.

00:03:30.766 --> 00:03:32.425
And we’ve set up a website

00:03:32.641 --> 00:03:34.348
to show everyone what we’re doing

00:03:34.404 --> 00:03:35.427
and we’re attracting

00:03:35.468 --> 00:03:37.436
more friends who want to join in.

00:03:38.059 --> 00:03:40.432
That’s the thing with online friendships –

00:03:40.634 --> 00:03:43.491
sometimes they carry over into the real world,

00:03:43.866 --> 00:03:46.176
and you can do some amazing things.
