PART 2

00:00:21.659 --> 00:00:22.198
Mark: Rachel?

00:00:23.002 --> 00:00:23.407
You OK?

00:00:24.686 --> 00:00:25.313
Rachel: Oh,

00:00:25.894 --> 00:00:26.814
I'm sorry, love.

00:00:27.976 --> 00:00:29.135
I'm just a bit worried.

00:00:30.098 --> 00:00:31.764
Jo phoned today and said that the old

00:00:31.797 --> 00:00:33.138
bookshop is going to be turned into

00:00:33.163 --> 00:00:34.394
another florist's.

00:00:34.419 --> 00:00:35.586
Mark: The bookshop on the corner?

00:00:36.263 --> 00:00:37.398
I didn’t know they’d sold it.

00:00:38.161 --> 00:00:38.709
Rachel: Me neither.

00:00:39.901 --> 00:00:41.028
What am I going to do?

00:00:41.983 --> 00:00:43.737
It's hard enough already to make money,

00:00:43.793 --> 00:00:45.491
but I think it’s going to be impossible

00:00:45.516 --> 00:00:47.510
with another florist’s in the same street.

00:00:47.622 --> 00:00:48.154
Mark: Yeah ...

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:49.989
Was Jo sure about this?

00:00:50.483 --> 00:00:51.253
Rachel: I don’t know.

00:00:51.804 --> 00:00:53.105
She seemed pretty certain.

00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:56.002
Mark: Well, if you ask me, it's not worth worrying about until we know for sure.

00:00:56.672 --> 00:00:57.053
Rachel: I know

00:00:59.096 --> 00:01:00.223
but I can't help it –

00:01:00.859 --> 00:01:01.907
it's on my mind.

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:03.996
I was even rude to a customer today.

00:01:04.291 --> 00:01:04.743
Mark: Really?

00:01:05.595 --> 00:01:06.920
That's not like you. What happened?

00:01:07.796 --> 00:01:09.272
Rachel: Well, I wasn't exactly rude,

00:01:09.504 --> 00:01:11.988
just not very helpful.

00:01:12.094 --> 00:01:12.514
Mark: Hey,

00:01:12.808 --> 00:01:14.118
don't worry about it.

00:01:14.747 --> 00:01:16.208
Let’s just forget about work.

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:18.455
Personally, I need a relaxing evening!

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:19.123
Rachel: Me too!

00:01:19.522 --> 00:01:19.958
Mark: Anyway,

00:01:19.983 --> 00:01:21.307
Tom and Becky will be here in a minute.

00:01:21.332 --> 00:01:22.611
I think we should check on the food.

00:01:22.779 --> 00:01:23.421
Rachel: Yes.

00:01:24.091 --> 00:01:24.455
I don't want

00:01:24.503 --> 00:01:26.257
anything else to go wrong today.

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:28.524
So, what’s Becky like?

00:01:29.849 --> 00:01:30.627
Mark: That’ll be them now!
