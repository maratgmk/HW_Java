Track 01.16

00:00:04.542 --> 00:00:05.193
Rachel: Oh,

00:00:05.796 --> 00:00:06.701
I'm sorry, love.

00:00:07.855 --> 00:00:09.022
I'm just a bit worried.

00:00:09.985 --> 00:00:11.810
Jo phoned today and said that the old

00:00:11.851 --> 00:00:13.001
bookshop is going to be turned into

00:00:13.026 --> 00:00:13.962
another florist's.

00:00:13.987 --> 00:00:15.494
Mark: The bookshop on the corner?

00:00:16.118 --> 00:00:17.293
I didn’t know they’d sold it.

00:00:18.032 --> 00:00:18.588
Rachel: Me neither.

00:00:19.782 --> 00:00:20.925
But what am I going to do?

00:00:21.878 --> 00:00:23.609
It's hard enough already to make money,

00:00:23.698 --> 00:00:25.205
but I think it’s going to be impossible

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:27.381
with another florist’s in the same street.
