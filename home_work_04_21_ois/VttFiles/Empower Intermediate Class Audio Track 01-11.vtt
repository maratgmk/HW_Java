PART 1

00:00:06.047 --> 00:00:06.698
Rachel: Really? ...

00:00:09.211 --> 00:00:10.267
Oh, no ...

00:00:10.268 --> 00:00:11.283
the bookshop!? ...

00:00:12.643 --> 00:00:13.643
Wha ... Are you sure?

00:00:15.224 --> 00:00:16.541
Rachel: thanks for letting me know ...

00:00:17.298 --> 00:00:20.181
yes, see you soon, Jo ... Bye.

00:00:23.162 --> 00:00:24.050
Becky: Excuse me?

00:00:24.958 --> 00:00:26.680
Rachel: Oh, sorry! I thought you were just looking.

00:00:26.792 --> 00:00:28.785
Becky: Um, I want something for a friend's wife.

00:00:29.161 --> 00:00:30.176
I’m going there for dinner.

00:00:30.573 --> 00:00:31.065
Rachel: OK.

00:00:31.742 --> 00:00:33.258
What sort of flowers does she like?

00:00:34.365 --> 00:00:36.420
Becky: Oh, I don't know. I haven’t met her yet.

00:00:37.208 --> 00:00:37.970
Rachel: Right ...

00:00:38.575 --> 00:00:39.607
well, in my opinion,

00:00:39.632 --> 00:00:41.163
roses are always a good option.

00:00:42.636 --> 00:00:45.160
Becky: Um ... Aren’t they a bit ... romantic?

00:00:46.132 --> 00:00:46.648
Rachel: Um,

00:00:47.108 --> 00:00:48.465
yes, I know what you mean.

00:00:48.721 --> 00:00:50.743
Rachel: I guess something like tulips

00:00:50.768 --> 00:00:51.287
might be better.

00:00:51.312 --> 00:00:52.771
Becky: Yes, they're lovely.

00:00:53.554 --> 00:00:54.379
How much are they?

00:00:57.654 --> 00:00:59.646
Becky: Erm, how much are the tulips?

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.750
Rachel: Oh, they're ...

00:01:01.959 --> 00:01:02.959
Rachel: ... sorry.

00:01:05.192 --> 00:01:05.930
Becky: It's OK.

00:01:06.067 --> 00:01:07.456
I'll try somewhere else. Thank you.

00:01:09.213 --> 00:01:09.689
Rachel: Hello? ...

00:01:10.658 --> 00:01:11.253
Yes.

00:01:12.669 --> 00:01:13.256
Yes, it is.
