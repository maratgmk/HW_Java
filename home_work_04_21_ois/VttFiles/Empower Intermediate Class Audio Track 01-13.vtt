00:00:05.345 --> 00:00:05.797
Rachel: Well,

00:00:06.226 --> 00:00:07.147
in my opinion,

00:00:07.736 --> 00:00:09.585
roses are always a good option.

00:00:13.473 --> 00:00:14.504
Rachel: I guess something like

00:00:14.529 --> 00:00:15.877

with another florist’s in the same street.

Mark: Well, if you ask me,

00:00:30.222 --> 00:00:30.913
it's not worth

00:00:30.952 --> 00:00:32.778
worrying about until we know for sure.
