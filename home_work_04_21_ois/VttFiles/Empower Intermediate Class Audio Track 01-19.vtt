Track 01.19

00:00:04.539 --> 00:00:06.023
Maria: How’s your revision going?

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:07.779
Gilberto: Not so good.

00:00:08.662 --> 00:00:10.213
I think I can remember most of

00:00:10.269 --> 00:00:10.912
the grammar,

00:00:11.451 --> 00:00:12.371
but remembering

00:00:12.396 --> 00:00:13.760
vocabulary’s a bit harder,

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:15.088
for me anyway.

00:00:15.732 --> 00:00:16.288
Maria: Yes,

00:00:16.852 --> 00:00:18.829
there are a lot of words to remember.

00:00:19.673 --> 00:00:20.506
Gilberto: What about you?

00:00:21.183 --> 00:00:21.802
Maria: For me,

00:00:22.089 --> 00:00:23.811
it is probably the opposite –

00:00:24.488 --> 00:00:25.933
I find the grammar hard

00:00:25.981 --> 00:00:27.394
to get my head around,

00:00:27.841 --> 00:00:29.801
but the vocabulary is a lot easier.

00:00:30.281 --> 00:00:31.717
I’ve been testing myself at home,

00:00:31.742 --> 00:00:32.614
and it’s OK.

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:34.419
Gilberto: How do you manage

00:00:34.483 --> 00:00:36.031
to remember all the words, though?

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:37.571
What’s your secret?

00:00:38.193 --> 00:00:39.900
Maria: Well, it’s no secret!

00:00:40.817 --> 00:00:43.070
I have this kind of system for learning

00:00:43.095 --> 00:00:45.293
words that seems to make it easy …

00:00:45.771 --> 00:00:46.255
Gilberto: OK,

00:00:46.708 --> 00:00:47.160
what?

00:00:48.315 --> 00:00:48.894
Maria: Well,

00:00:49.301 --> 00:00:50.920
when I get home from class,

00:00:51.293 --> 00:00:53.039
I record all the new words I’ve

00:00:53.079 --> 00:00:54.341
learned onto my phone.

00:00:55.163 --> 00:00:57.005
And then I might do something like

00:00:57.499 --> 00:01:00.539
go for a run, and I listen to them when I’m running.

00:01:01.473 --> 00:01:05.004
And I make up these sentences with the words and say them to myself.

00:01:05.587 --> 00:01:06.420
Gilberto: As you’re running?

00:01:06.898 --> 00:01:08.120
Maria: Yes, as I’m running –

00:01:08.892 --> 00:01:11.352
I just say the sentences quietly to myself.

00:01:12.325 --> 00:01:13.165
Gilberto: Do you remember what

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:14.047
the words mean?

00:01:14.827 --> 00:01:15.731
Maria: Most of the time.

00:01:16.504 --> 00:01:17.313
If I forget,

00:01:17.338 --> 00:01:19.394
I check in my notebook when I get home

00:01:19.419 --> 00:01:20.085
from my run.

00:01:20.755 --> 00:01:21.683
And sometimes

00:01:21.708 --> 00:01:23.763
I play the words and write them down.

00:01:24.648 --> 00:01:26.100
I think the most important

00:01:26.197 --> 00:01:28.038
thing is to keep repeating them.

00:01:28.843 --> 00:01:29.724
I don’t know why,

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:31.248
but remembering the sounds of

00:01:31.273 --> 00:01:32.883
the words is important for me.

00:01:33.792 --> 00:01:34.324
Like,

00:01:34.404 --> 00:01:36.856
last week I learned the word ‘shine’ –

00:01:37.748 --> 00:01:39.494
you know, like ‘the sun is shining’.

00:01:40.776 --> 00:01:43.228
And that ‘sh’ sound at the beginning

00:01:43.252 --> 00:01:43.935
of the word

00:01:44.486 --> 00:01:46.851
makes me think of light that’s getting

00:01:46.876 --> 00:01:48.105
brighter and brighter.

00:01:49.141 --> 00:01:49.959
Gilberto: Interesting.

00:01:50.904 --> 00:01:52.698
But I don’t know if it would work for me.

00:01:53.424 --> 00:01:55.408
I need to see things written down.

00:01:56.006 --> 00:01:57.363
I need to look at the word.

00:01:57.873 --> 00:02:00.190
Maria: Right – my sister’s like that, too.

00:02:00.773 --> 00:02:02.567
She uses vocabulary cards.

00:02:02.686 --> 00:02:03.606
Have you tried that?

00:02:04.108 --> 00:02:04.513
Gilberto: No.

00:02:05.276 --> 00:02:06.236
How does that work?

00:02:06.922 --> 00:02:08.954
Maria: She has these small cards

00:02:09.155 --> 00:02:11.797
and writes all the new words on a card

00:02:11.822 --> 00:02:12.553
with a picture,

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:15.000
or a definition and an example –

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:17.185
sometimes a translation, too.

00:02:17.957 --> 00:02:19.393
It worked really well …

00:02:20.063 --> 00:02:21.134
for a while.

00:02:21.535 --> 00:02:22.297
Gilberto: For a while?

00:02:22.973 --> 00:02:24.147
Why? What happened?

00:02:24.768 --> 00:02:27.276
Maria: She left all the cards on the train.

00:02:27.795 --> 00:02:28.763
Gilberto: Oh, yes.

00:02:29.168 --> 00:02:30.779
That’s probably what I would do!

00:02:31.441 --> 00:02:33.124
Maria: I felt so sorry for her –

00:02:33.514 --> 00:02:34.856
after all that work.

00:02:35.159 --> 00:02:36.604
Gilberto: It sounds like a good idea,

00:02:37.058 --> 00:02:38.804
but it sounds like you have to be quite

00:02:38.829 --> 00:02:40.575
organised to have a card system.

00:02:40.982 --> 00:02:42.292
Maria: Yes, that’s true.

00:02:42.754 --> 00:02:43.620
Gilberto: And, to be honest,

00:02:44.097 --> 00:02:46.423
I think I’m maybe too lazy to write

00:02:46.448 --> 00:02:47.603
all those cards and

00:02:47.746 --> 00:02:49.421
keep them with me wherever I go!
