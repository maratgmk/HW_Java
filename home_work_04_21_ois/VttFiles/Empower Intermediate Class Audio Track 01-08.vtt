00:00:00.563 --> 00:00:02.206
TRACK 01.08

00:00:04.159 --> 00:00:04.627
Narrator: 1

00:00:06.126 --> 00:00:07.865
Speaker 1: Are you OK, James?

00:00:08.438 --> 00:00:09.280
Speaker 2: I’m OK,

00:00:09.733 --> 00:00:10.955
but I’m really tired.

00:00:11.275 --> 00:00:13.442
I’ve been speaking Spanish all day!

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:16.008
Narrator: 2

00:00:17.518 --> 00:00:18.494
Speaker 3: Hi, Linda.

00:00:19.305 --> 00:00:20.869
Are you learning Russian?

00:00:21.348 --> 00:00:22.451
Speaker 4: I’m trying to,

00:00:22.858 --> 00:00:25.041
but this book’s absolutely useless!

00:00:25.616 --> 00:00:27.013
It teaches you how to say

00:00:27.038 --> 00:00:29.046
‘my uncle’s black trousers’

00:00:29.532 --> 00:00:30.928
but not how to say ‘hello’!

00:00:33.012 --> 00:00:33.464
Narrator: 3

00:00:35.181 --> 00:00:36.999
Speaker 5: Hey, guess what?

00:00:37.118 --> 00:00:38.976
I’ve just read about this girl,

00:00:39.073 --> 00:00:40.677
and she’s only 10,

00:00:40.742 --> 00:00:42.417
but she’s fluent in several

00:00:42.442 --> 00:00:43.560
different languages.

00:00:44.175 --> 00:00:45.897
Speaker 6: That’s absolutely amazing.

00:00:46.297 --> 00:00:48.003
I can only speak one language –

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:49.058
English.

00:00:51.174 --> 00:00:51.769
Narrator: 4

00:00:53.191 --> 00:00:54.564
Speaker 7: Listen, Olivier:

00:00:55.099 --> 00:00:56.091
squirrel!!

00:00:56.656 --> 00:00:57.870
Speaker 8: Squi…

00:00:58.260 --> 00:00:59.165
Squill...

00:00:59.754 --> 00:01:00.849
It’s very hard!

00:01:00.986 --> 00:01:02.263
I’ll never get it right!

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:04.392
Speaker 7: Yeah, I know it’s difficult.

00:01:04.417 --> 00:01:05.495
You need to practise.

00:01:05.871 --> 00:01:06.490
Try again.

00:01:07.071 --> 00:01:07.475
Listen:

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:09.254
squirrel.

00:01:09.788 --> 00:01:10.169
Speaker 8: Squi...

00:01:10.256 --> 00:01:11.550
rrel…

00:01:12.238 --> 00:01:13.071
Speaker 7: Well done!
